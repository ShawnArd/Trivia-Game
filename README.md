# Trivia-Game

In this Javascript/Jquery based game I will be making use of the set time function to create a timed quiz game where users are given 
a set time to answer questions. Each question will have a designated time limit and if an answer is not given before the time ends it 
will be counted as unanswered and the game will proceed to the next question. At the end of the Quiz a score will be displayed to show 
how well the player did.
